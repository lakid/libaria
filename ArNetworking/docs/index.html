<p>ArNetworking is an extensible networking protocol and infrastructure. It is used to add networking services to a robot control program, integrated with ARIA and other MobileRobots software libraries.</p>
<p>ArNetworking is used to set up a client-server architecture. A client issues <em>requests</em> to a server to issue a single command the server, or to start retrieving data from the server at a specified time interval. A request type is identified by a short string.</p>
<p>A client may be an operator's graphical interface, or a component requiring off-board resources (such as a multi-robot planning system, for example). However, a program onboard the robot could also implement a client, and issue requests to an offboard server (e.g. to retrieve data from a central database).</p>
<p>In a typical application, however, a program acting as the server runs on the robot's computer, and uses ARIA (and possibly ARNL or SONARNL) to control the robot. This creates a three-tier system: the robot itself is the first tier, and acts as a "robot server" to a program on its onboard computer which is simultaneously a "robot client" and an "ArNetworking server". Offboard ArNetworking clients are the final tier. This three-tier architecture allows a tight, reliable control loop between the robot control program on the onboard computer, and removes higher level user-interface clients accross the potentially unreliable network, protecting the more critical robot control program, and providing a more immediate and flexible user interface.</p>
<p>ArNetworking can use both TCP and UDP.</p>

Abstract overview of ArNetworking in a typical client-server configuration with one client issuing requests to a server</div></div>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Servers"></a>
Servers</h2>
<p>An ArNetworking server program is comprised of an <a class="el" href="classArServerBase.html" title="Base server for all networking services.">ArServerBase</a> object, to which callback functors are added for each request type you wish to handle (keyed by a request identifier string, though this string is internally converted into a more efficient integer value) using <a class="el" href="classArServerBase.html#a2df604c980c35140f69d35362a3403f2" title="Adds a callback to be called when requests for some data are recieved.">ArServerBase::addData()</a>. These callbacks are often encapsulated in "ServerHandler" or "ServerInfo" classes. The ArNetworking library provides a variety of prewritten classes for providing current state information about the robot, and for teleoperation control. A callback functor for a request, when invoked, receives an <a class="el" href="classArNetPacket.html" title="our packet for the network stuff">ArNetPacket</a> object containing the request's payload data, and a pointer to an object used to send a reply packet to the client. <a class="el" href="classArServerBase.html" title="Base server for all networking services.">ArServerBase</a> creates a background thread to asyncronously accept client connections and receive clients' requests, while your main program thread executes simultaneously. This thread runs in a loop, and you may add general-purpose callback functors to be invoked each cycle of this loop using <a class="el" href="classArServerBase.html#a1dd6a24a2047f58b072e81c0738422d5" title="Add a callback to be called at every cycle.">ArServerBase::addCycleCallback()</a>.</p>
<p>To simplify server program setup, a helper class <a class="el" href="classArServerSimpleOpener.html" title="Set up and open an ArNetworking server.">ArServerSimpleOpener</a> is available.</p>
<p>The default port number for an <a class="el" href="classArServerBase.html" title="Base server for all networking services.">ArServerBase</a> object to open is 7272, though an alternate port number may be used via a command line argument to the program, or specified in the <a class="el" href="classArServerBase.html" title="Base server for all networking services.">ArServerBase</a> constructor.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="ServerModes"></a>
Server Modes</h3>
<p>ArNetworking also provides a system of server mode classes (see <a class="el" href="classArServerMode.html" title="A mode for controlling the robot (only one active)">ArServerMode</a> base class). The server may only be in one mode at a time, each of which enables and disables ARIA <a class="elRef" doxygen="Aria.tag:../../docs/" href="../../docs/classArAction.html">ArAction</a> objects.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="SimpleServerCommands"></a>
Simple Server Commands</h3>
<p>ArNetworking includes the <a class="el" href="classArServerHandlerCommands.html" title="Class for having commands that can be called easily on the client.">ArServerHandlerCommands</a> class that provides a very simple API for simple "command" requests: requests, perhaps with a few parameters, that simply perform some action or change some state, and have no data to reply with. Callback functors added for requests via an <a class="el" href="classArServerHandlerCommands.html" title="Class for having commands that can be called easily on the client.">ArServerHandlerCommands</a> object do not receive the request packet data, so they do not need to do any decoding of that data. Additionally, <a class="el" href="classArServerHandlerCommands.html" title="Class for having commands that can be called easily on the client.">ArServerHandlerCommands</a> keeps a list of requests that it manages, which is available to clients. ArNetworking includes some prewritten classes (ArServerSimpleCom*) which simply add new commands to an <a class="el" href="classArServerHandlerCommands.html" title="Class for having commands that can be called easily on the client.">ArServerHandlerCommands</a> object and encapsulate their request callbacks.</p>
<p>For example, MobileEyes queries this list on connection, and if some of these simple commands are available, it makes a menu in the toolbar called Custom Commands accessible. This is a way to make special features of your custom robot server application controllable from MobileEyes.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="ARNLServerClasses"></a>
Networking in ARNL and SONARNL</h3>
<p>The ARNL and SONARNL libraries contain some ServerHandler/ServerInfo classes that implement useful server requests, as well as server Mode classes.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="PreMadeServices"></a>
Standard Services Available in ArNetworking</h3>
<p>These are some of the pre-written services which are available in the ArNetworking library for you to use in your server programs. To use these services, your server program typically only needs to create and retain an instance of the class, though some require some additional setup.</p>

</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Clients"></a>
Clients</h2>
<p>A client program is comprised of an <a class="el" href="classArClientBase.html" title="The base client class.">ArClientBase</a> object which must be connected to a server via a network socket (either TCP or the default, UDP). The server is identified by network hostname and port number, which may be given through <a class="el" href="classArClientBase.html" title="The base client class.">ArClientBase</a> API or in the program command line arguments. Requests are made to the server via <a class="el" href="classArClientBase.html#a0a36a40fe2598eb214368ae8c3a26ca1" title="Request some data every mSec milliseconds.">ArClientBase::request()</a> or <a class="el" href="classArClientBase.html#a2dcd11daf8d2045d460b83733e6932d0" title="Request some data (or send a command) just once.">ArClientBase::requestOnce()</a>. Callback functors may be added to the <a class="el" href="classArClientBase.html" title="The base client class.">ArClientBase</a> object to receive reply packets. <a class="el" href="classArClientBase.html" title="The base client class.">ArClientBase</a> creates a background thread to asyncronously communicate with the server.</p>
<p>A client may query a server to discover if a data request type is available using <a class="el" href="classArClientBase.html#a873a731b968b4e3359c60d592122770b" title="Sees if this data exists.">ArClientBase::dataExists()</a>.</p>
<p>To simplify client program setup and connection to a server, a helper class <a class="el" href="classArClientSimpleConnector.html" title="This will let you connect to different hosts, ports, and with different users and passwords more easi...">ArClientSimpleConnector</a> is available.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Auth"></a>
Authenticated Connections</h2>
<p>A simple scheme for authenticated connections is available in ArNetworking. When connecting to a server, a client may supply a username and password. If the server has loaded a <em>user info file</em>, it may reject a connection with an incorrect password. Data requests may be categorized into <em>command groups</em>, and which command groups are allowed to which users may be specified in the user info file.</p>
<p>The login process is not impossible to defeat with some concerted effort and expertise, but is sufficient to prevent basic attempts at unauthorized use of a server, and to present only relevant features for different users' purposes.</p>
<p>See <a class="el" href="classArServerBase.html" title="Base server for all networking services.">ArServerBase</a> for more discussion. </p>
